# About this file
# Food servers’ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many
# factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table
# locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors
# matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale,
# they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair
# treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the United
# States) are a major component of pay.
# In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all cus-
# tomers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990.
# The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national
# chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law, the restaurant
# offered to seat in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each
# record includes a day and time, and taken together, they show the server’s
# work schedule.
